# Web Scraping Mars Live Data
## Overview
I am tasked with gathering data about Mars in one website. In this website I created an app that scrapes for new Mars data every time it is prompted to. The data is scraped from a NASA website and the Mission to Mars website. To create this website I used Python, MongoDB and Bootstrap to host a scraping website locally. 
## Results

### Customization
- "Red" Scrape Button
- Responsiveness
- Thumbnail images

## Conclusion
There is ample opportunity for customization. The website does well at scraping the most recent information about Mars, but it could be more aesthetically inviting.
